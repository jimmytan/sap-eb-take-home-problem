# Introduction
This project is for the SAP take home problem.

We the North American team who are split across Boulder and Montreal often enjoy spending time in the outdoors. Some of us would like to bike while some of us are happy just walking, some of us like to challenge ourselves with difficult hikes while some of us would like to ease in slowly.

The good part is that the Boulder county releases data about the trails as open data. Your assignment is to help us find a trail that suits our requirement.

# Architecture
The project is hosted to AWS. The data can be accessed by the Web API.
